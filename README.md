# HackMyDegree
CS 348 Group Project - HackMyDegree
Premise: Hack My Degree allows Purdue computer science majors to plan an efficient schedule to complete all track (concentrations) requirements and electives. 

Remark: This project was completed for the CS 348 (Information Systems) course at Purdue. As a result, certain design choices were taken to fulfill project specifications (e.g., employing the use of both an ORM and non-ORM library). Additionally, the code quality is not representative of our collective ability per aforementioned reasoning.
